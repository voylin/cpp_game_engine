# Meikyuu Engine

This engine is a work in progress, but being put on hold to try Java instead.
For people wanting to run this engine, copy the GAME_DIR contents to another folder and the rest of the files go into a folder called meikyuu_engine.

The builder is just a bash script and this is made on linux, so when trying this on windows you may need to change certain commands. Good luck!!
